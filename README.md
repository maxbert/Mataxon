##Weclome To Scrabble!
Here at Mataxon we enjoy a good word game, so we figured we'd let you have one to play on your computer!


##Instructions

##Two Player Only

1. Open Scrabble.pde in Processing (let it sit to let images  load)
2. Run Scrabble.pde
  ⋅⋅1. if it crashes, just ignore it and run again (Sometimes the images don't load properly)
3. Click to continue
4. Player one begins by playing a word which starts at the center tile
  ⋅⋅1. Begin by clicking on a tile in your tray, and then clicking a space on the board
  ⋅⋅2. If you mess up, click undo and all your tiles will return to your hand
  ⋅⋅3. Play a word on special tiles to increase your score
5. Player two must play off that tile to make a crossword
6. Scores are added up and when the bag is emptied, the person with the highest score wins.
7. We wanted to code AI but that proved to be problematic, so gather a friend before playing.
