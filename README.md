##Weclome To Scrabble!
Here at Mataxon we enjoy a good word game, so we figured we'd let you have one to play on your computer!


##Instructions

##Two Player Only

1. Open Scrabble.pde in Processing (let it sit to let images  load)
2. Run Scrabble.pde
  2a. if it crashes, just ignore it and run again (i dont kno wwhy this happens
3. Click to continue
4. Player one begins by playing a word which starts at the center tile
  4a. Begin by clicking on a tile in your tray, and then clicking a space on the board
  4b. If you mess up, click undo and all your tiles will return to your hand
  4c. Play a word on special tiles to increase your score

5. Player two must play off that tile to make a crossword
6. Scores are added up and when the bag is emptied, the person with the highest score wins.
7. We wanted to code AI but that proved to be problematic, so gather a friend before playing.
